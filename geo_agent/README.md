# Run http-server to make output.json file generated by geo_agent accessible by kosmtik
Command to run to spin up server is

http-server -a 192.168.1.229 -p 8000 --cors

N.B. May need to manually assign IP address to ensure connection as IP address hardcoded into project.html file at the moment. In Mac Go to 'System Preferences' and then 'Network'. Click on 'Advanced'. Select 'TCP/IP'. Turn Configure IPv4 to 'Use DHCP with manual address' and then type 192.168.1.229 into IPv4 address box. Make sure to apply changes after clicking ok.


# Git commit changes to version 0.0.17 as this is the version that is being used by my docker kosmtik container. Not ideal but at the moment I am overwriting my changes on to this tagged version by forcing the commits:

git push --force origin  HEAD:0.0.17
